metrics supporting a conference paper examining judicial
readability and citation practices across jurisdictions.

## Contents
- `scripts/` – text cleaning and analysis scripts
- `data/` – derived numerical metrics (Excel files)

## Method Overview

then analysed using standard NLP tools to compute readability
and citation-related metrics.

All shared files consist solely of derived numerical metrics.

## Reproducibility
Scripts are provided to document the analytical pipeline
and support methodological transparency.
